# Purpose

Most validation libraries are either hard to use, missing key features, or no longer maintained. It’s tough to find one that lets you reuse rules, supports multiple languages, and still feels easy to work with.

Robust Validator was built to solve that. It makes validation simple, reusable, and flexible. You can define your rules once and use them anywhere, and it works great with multiple languages out of the box.

If you want a validation library that just works, is easy to read, and stays up to date, Robust Validator is a solid choice.
