# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: July 12, 2025_

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any data you share with us. This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that information.

## 1. Who we are

This website is a documentation site operated by Özgür Adem Işıklı. It does not include forms, logins, or other features that directly collect personal data from users.

If you have questions about this policy or your data, you can contact us at [i.ozguradem@gmail.com](mailto:i.ozguradem@gmail.com).

## 2. What data we collect

We do **not** collect personal data such as your name, email address, or IP address directly.

However, we use Google Analytics to collect anonymized usage statistics that help us understand how visitors interact with our website.

## 3. Use of cookies

This site uses:

- **Strictly necessary cookies** to ensure the website functions properly
- **Analytics cookies**, which are optional and used only with your consent

Analytics cookies are not loaded unless you explicitly accept them through the cookie consent banner.

See our [Cookie Policy](/cookie-policy) for detailed information.

## 4. Data collected via Google Analytics

Google Analytics may collect the following types of information:

- Pages visited
- Time spent on each page
- Referring website or URL
- Browser and device type
- Approximate geolocation (city-level)

We have configured Google Analytics to **anonymize IP addresses**, so your full IP address is never stored or processed.

All collected data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.

## 5. Legal basis for processing

In accordance with Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR, we process analytics data only after obtaining your **explicit consent**.

You can withdraw your consent at any time using the "Cookie Settings" link in the website footer.

## 6. Data sharing

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your personal data.

We share anonymized usage data with Google LLC through Google Analytics. You can read more about how Google uses this data in their [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## 7. Your rights under GDPR

You have the right to:

- Access the data we hold about you (if any)
- Request correction or deletion of your data
- Withdraw your consent at any time
- Lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority

Since this website does not store personal information or use user accounts, most of these rights are not applicable in practice. However, we are happy to respond to any questions or requests you may have.

## 8. Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
